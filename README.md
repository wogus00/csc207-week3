# Project Description
## Collaborative Task Management Platform
When working as a team, it is essential for all members to stay on track of the project by sharing their updates and organize meeting schedules with each other. 
For our project, we will be building a collaborative task management platform that can help the team to progress on their project and boost their productivity
Some of the features that we are considering are:
1. task creation / deletion / completion 
2. announcement for members 
3. calendar for scheduling and deadlines 
4. email notifications
