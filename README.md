# Project Description
## Collaborative Task Management Platform
When working as a team, it is essential for all members to stay on track of the project by sharing their updates and organize meeting schedules with each other. 
For our project, we will be building a collaborative task management platform that can help the team to progress on their project and boost their productivity
Some of the features that we are considering are:
1. task creation / deletion / completion 
2. announcement for members 
3. calendar for scheduling and deadlines 
4. email notifications

# API Documentation
# Screenshot of using a tool to try out the API

# example output of running our Java code

# list of any technical problems blocking progress
1. When we got an IOException error, we might want to have more information.
2. We might have network issues such as connectivity issues, timeouts, or server errors.
3. We also need to consider "OutOfMemoryError" especially for large files.
4. We also want to make sure to not make conflict when two or more people try update.
